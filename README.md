This is the first project in the series of projects that will help you think about how to build data products powered by
Machine Learning.

I recently started reading this book[Building Machine Learning Powered Applications](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/building-machine-learning/9781492045106/) and trying to apply the lessons learned from the book
to building simple projects and get hands on experience on how to think about ML projects and evolving these projects to go from simple to more sophisticated methods.

## Shopify App Store Grader

The idea of this project is to grade the shopify app store landing page. We will let the app builder
to have a good landing page which is crisp in its messaging and help ecommerce store owners
to understand the value proposition of the app and install it.
