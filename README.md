Machine Learning. I recently started reading this book[Building Machine Learning Powered Applications](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/building-machine-learning/9781492045106/) and trying to build applications as I read through the chapters.

## Shopify App Store Grader

The idea of this project is to grade the shopify app store landing page. We will let the app builder
to have a good landing page which is crisp in its messaging and help ecommerce store owners
to understand the value proposition of the app and install it.
